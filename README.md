## A visualization of the Collatz Conjecture

The [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), also known as the Hailstone Conjecture, starts with what appears to be a silly math 'game'. 
Given any positive whole number you use the following two rules

* if the number is even, divide it by 2
* if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1

With the resultant number repeat the process. The chain of numbers may bounce around going higher or lower, but the Collatz Conjecture states that
eventually *all* numbers will end up at 1. This has been tested up to numbers as high as 2^60. There is no proof, however, and Paul ErdÅ‘s said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems." He offered $500 for its solution.

One usually draws graphs of these chains such as

As you can imagine as the numbers get larger, the 'limbs' of the tree can get quite long.

A couple of points, that may not be immediately obvious.
* The major limbs of the graph (the horizontal runs) are just multiples of two
* Spurs, (the first node of a new limb) always start with an odd number
* The graft points, where a limb attaches is always an even number
* Except for the 1<-->4 cycle, there are no cycles, and each number is only represented in the tree once.

This program attempts to draw a 3D visualization of this graph.
